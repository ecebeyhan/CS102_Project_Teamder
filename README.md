# CS102 Project_Teamder
* People are having difficulty finding teammates while doing team sports in daily life. In or-der to overcome this challenge, we will develop a sophisticated desktop application that brings together many related people for certain team sports. Obviously, our target users will be people looking for a team in these sports. Our program also targets people who go to places where they are foreign. Our ultimate purpose is to encourage people to join team sports and socialize with people.
